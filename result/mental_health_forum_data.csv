0,plantparentnico,New member,"Hello, so at my (he/him) last therapy session (the first therapy session with a new therapist - she/her) she said i might have ADHD. She said she started to have suspicions when i said ""i really love reading books, it has always been my passion and my escape from reality, but these days i just can't get myself to read, even tho i really want to, i just can't."" i also spoke to her about how it's difficult for me to do simple stuff like washing dishes, cleaning, doing homework or learning for exams. i just procrastinate. i know i have to do it but i just can't get up to start anything. i have to have a outside impulse, for example when my mum needs help with something. what she said is that im fighting my brain. i know i need to, i kinda even want to do it (cuz i like to have clean dishes or clothes in it's place) but my brain says no and since he's the one in control, i don't do anything. there might be more stuff but this stayed in my mind till now. i want to see other people's experience and opinions. i kinda want to ask my psychiatrist to help me get a diagnosis but i have some time till im meeting with them, so i need something. thank you for your answers!",2,ADHD_Forum

4,Ark227,New member,"Hello all, I am diagnosed with ADHD. I take generic Adderall but it doesn't help much. I have a intro post that is more in depth, but here's my ADHD focused issue:

When things are difficult, my mind wanders. I can't force myself to focus on difficult problems. If its a simple issue, one I know exactly how to solve, I'm fine. I just do it. But if its something difficult to figure out, my mind drags me away to think about something else more pleasant. I don't want to, but its like I don't have control. The Adderall can help, but it just as easily helps me laser focus on the distraction.

Does anyone have any experience dealing with this? Methods, medications, anything that can help me focus on the correct target?",2,ADHD_Forum
5,Angel R,Member,"Hi again! I posted about my RSD, and here I'd like to know if these other things sound like ADHD.
Don't worry, this post is A LOT shorter than my RSD one!
Obsessions/impulsivity - When I learn about a new hobby or topic, I'll spend most of my 8 hour work shift listening to podcasts or videos about the new Topic in my earbuds. I'll think about it all the time and learn everything I possibly can about it in a short amount of time. I'll keep a list in my head of the most important bullet points of how to correctly do this new thing, and I'll start dreaming of all the wonderful things I'm going to create.

I'll also figure out the basic supply items I need to get, and I'll start to drool over them on Amazon. Now, I still make sure my bills are paid, but as soon as I can afford the items I'll usually get them and start learning how to do whatever it is. I need to buy them NOW, or ASAP. I have learned some impulse control over purchasing these things, because money is really tight sometimes, but that was hard to learn. I'll get this irritatingly strong urge to buy the supplies so I can start my new hobby! UNTIL.... I suddenly drop my new hobby and lose all interest in it, and I move onto the next new thing, where the cycle starts all over again.
I just did this today with a bunch of art and craft supplies because I want to start a YouTube channel with my daughter. Will it ever take off? Who knows! lol. but at last we're learning some new skills and having fun together. Unfortunately, we spent most of our evening together testing out these new products - painting, using clay, attempting (poorly) to make Barbie dresses, and crocheting - instead of cleaning the house and getting ready for the school/work week. *nervous laughter* heh...

I've been like this for most of my life. Get super obsessed with a new idea and learn a bunch about it until I get bored and move on. Only in these last few years have I actually had the money to act on my impulses. I still get the bills paid, but I have no savings to speak of. I really should get the brakes on our car looked at... but.. but art supplies!!!!
Oh yeah, I do this with people, too. Get super excited about my new amazing best-besty friendy-friend forever and ever!!!

Until... I can't even make myself open their message and I end up ghosting them even though they did NOTHING wrong.

So what do you think? Sound like an ADHD thing? Thanks",5,ADHD_Forum
6,Angel R,Member,"Hi everyone! I just joined this forum. I have many reasons for suspecting that I have ADHD, and definitely have undiagnosed OCD. I was hoping for some advice and/or insight on the likelihood that I have ADHD. Of course I am already going to talk to a therapist about that, but that's a ways out and I'm here right now.

Like I said, I have a lot of reasons why I suspect it, but I'll start with the RSD thing...

I was watching videos on YouTube about ADHD, and that's when I learned about RSD, and I thought, ""oh my gosh, this is me all the way!"" Please forgive my long writing, but I have a lot to say and I feel compelled to be as thorough as possible. This is kind of funny and sad but I feel my RSD coming out a little bit because I'm scared you guys are going to think this post is too long, but I'm just going to go with it.

So... I recently figured out that I probably have Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria, especially at my job. I push myself to do as perfect a job as possible out of constant fear of what my managers and coworkers think of me. Every minute of my work day I'm constantly away that I'm being watched on camera, and I'm scared to break any of the rules. Obviously rule breaking isn't ever a good thing, but I'm a little past the reasonable line on this one, and I know it.

I do work around a very toxic person (let's call her Sarah) and this person is very impatient and critical of everyone around them. I realize that's a fault within them, not within myself, but being around this person for 3+ years has brought out a ton of my own insecurities that I didn't realize I had. Unfortunately this person is in a supervisory role, and I'm supposed to go through them with any work issues before talking to the actual manager. Sarah can be really nice sometimes, but we have completely different worldviews and upbringing, and being around her every day for 8 hours gives me a lot of anxiety. She's finally starting to figure out that who I am, and that I'm sincerely not ""BSing"" them when I ask dumb questions, or when I am just different than everyone else.
I start to panic if I'm even 5 minutes late, so I always show up early. I have perfect attendance because I don't call in even when I'm sick, because I'm more scared of missing work than taking care of my own personal needs or even my family's needs. I'm constantly afraid of ""getting in trouble."" Everyone thinks I'm weird because I don't like to goof off while being punched in. I like to punch out before getting all my winter gear on at my locker, so I'm not wasting the company's time. Nobody else does that. I also try to keep my breaks within the right time, and not go over. Sarah doesn't do that, and I think she thinks i'm a goody-two-shoes for trying to adhere to the rules so closely.
I'm extremely hard on myself when I mess up, and if Sarah or my boss tells me that I messed something up, my mood starts to go downhill and I can't control it, especially when there's an instance of a thing being done incorrectly, and I know that it wasn't me, but the implication is that I was responsible. When they say ""Hey, you did such and such..."" I can't rest until they know that I DIDN'T DO THAT. But I always get told, ""Hey, I don't care WHO did it, but it was done wrong."" and for some reason I can't handle the thought that they thought that I was being blamed even though I know I didn't do it. Because if I had done whatever it was, I would own up to it and apologize and take full responsibility. I also over-explain EVERYTHING (like this post? lol!!!!) and apparently, Sarah and my manager actually get super annoyed with me when I over-explain. I cannot comprehend this!!! I just feel this irresistible urge to make sure they know WHY a thing happened, and the steps that led up to it, so that they have full context. Actually I hate it when Sarah tells me, ""Manager asked me why such-and-such wasn't done"". That was my task, but I actually had good reasons for not getting it done yet. But Manager doesn't care about that, he just wants to know why it wasn't done yet, and it's Sarah's job to keep everyone on task and micromanage us. But it scares me and freaks me out because my brain starts telling me, ""Manager thinks you're doing a bad job. You ARE doing a bad job. Do better next time, loser. I don't care if it kills you, you have to do better, be faster, work harder. Manager probably wants to replace you. Manager is annoyed because he knows you cry at work. They can do so much better than you.""

When I forget to do something correctly, or when I mess something up, I should be able to take constructive criticism like a normal person, but it accumulates throughout the day and I get very fragile inside. And then it just takes one critical remark or a judgmental look from Sarah to make me start crying, and once the tears start, I can't stop them. She gets impatient with me for crying, and then gets snooty with me and just says, ""I'm never telling YOU anything again."" which just makes it worse.

I feel like a normal person would be able to brush it off and go about their day, but I can't seem to do it. Even writing this I want to start tearing up. I have gotten better throughout the past year at my job, and Sarah is finally understanding that I have some issues and that she should just ignore my tears and say whatever she needs to say, because I want nothing more than to be good at my job. One of my biggest fears in life is losing my job, or giving them a bad impression of me. But it's too late. I've already embarrassed myself more times than I can count by crying in front of my coworkers and manager. I can't control it when it starts. After awhile I can shut off the waterworks, but my mood will be down the rest of the whole day.

But my RSD isn't just at work. I recently got a shoutout from my favorite Youtuber. She selected me as one of 5 people to receive a free book, and I got so excited. She told me to message her on Instagram, but I didn't own an instagram account, so I had to create one. I messaged her 2 weeks ago, and she hasn't gotten back to me. I tried several times, and I even commented on Youtube that I didn't think my messages were getting through to her. At this point I don't even care about the book, I just want to stop feeling ignored and rejected by her. My brain knows that this is silly, because she's got hundreds of thousands of followers, and I'm sure she's not purposely ignoring me... but it just feels like she's ignoring me, and it's making me want to cry. I could go on about other examples of feeling rejection even when I'm sure the person has no clue that I'm perceiving things that way, but I don't want to bore you guys.

Thanks for tolerating me, and I'd REALLY appreciate some feedback and maybe some examples from you guys if you have RSD also.

7,Blue Monday,Well-known member,"Sorry for the long intro/background info here:

I have ADHD Inattentive Type. I've over 50 and when I was young, long before being diagnosed, my thoughts were not only random and often having no relation to each other whatsoever, I say that my brain jumped from thought to thought at ""light speed"". There was nothing I could do about it. My thoughts have remained largely random at my age but thankfully the speed of jumping from thought to thought has gradually slowed down as I've aged.

What do I mean by ""random thought""? I mean thoughts that are not linear, new thoughts that don't have any relation to the previous thoughts.

My example of what I consider to a linear non-random thoughts: Seeing a container of cherry ice cream in the store and having my very next thought be a memory of eating cherry ice cream as a child. That makes sense.

My example of what I consider to be random thoughts: Thinking about chopping onions while I'm in the kitchen chopping onions and my very next thought that just pops in (randomly) is about painting a fence outside when I was 12. Zero relation between my current thoughts/activities to the random thought or memory that pops into my head. Zero.

An analogy is like one of those lottery ping pong ball machines with ping pong balls flying around inside completely random. That's how my thoughts have often been most of my life.

In the past few weeks I've been taking CBD gummies which include a very low amount of THC. One thing I've noticed and it's absolutely not imagined: The randomness of my thoughts has diminished almost completely. Based on how it has been and what I've been used to, it's incredible actually in a very good way.

I'm no stranger to THC as I was a chronic marijuana user for about a decade, over twenty years ago, but haven't used marijuana in any form since that time. I've been hesitant based on my past abuse of the drug to use it but decided to try these gummies and treat them like medicine (ie measured dose at ""micro-dose"" level and not deviate from that regimen). The amount I'm currently taking is extremely low and amounts to only 5mg CBD/0.25mg of THC in the morning and then the same again in the afternoon. I did start by taking a single dose of 10mg CBD/0.5mg THC and even though that level of THC is not regarded as being enough to be psychoactive, it could have been my imagination but I thought I felt an extremely light level of psychoactivity which as much as my brain would welcome such a thing based on my past, that's not what I'm looking to accomplish.

The ""quieting"" of my brain on this new regimen, if the CBD/THC does nothing else, is enough for me to want to continue with it.

This post is in no way advocating or recommending that any one else try this at all. I'm only speaking for myself with my own personal experience.",266,ADHD_Forum
8,Ampleforth,Well-known member,I'm so happy you've found relief from a natural plant product. It also works for chronic pain and a host of other issues. Beats the hell out of opiates. There are mental health issues that can be helped with cannabis (others not so much) and as OP mentioned CBD isn't psychoactive. Luckily it still contains beneficial cannabinoids and terpenes. Like you I'm not advocating the use of cannabis unless prescribed by a qualified doctor. Luckily in Florida we have plenty of those.,"1,140",ADHD_Forum
9,Blue Monday,Well-known member,"I tried a different brand of CBD that was ""THC free"" which in the fine print means less than 0.3% THC per dose. I took that for about a month and it didn't seem to do much of anything. I read more about it and whether it's true or not, what I did read said that CBD in absence of THC can't bind effectively to the receptors in the brain but if CBD is taken along with trace amounts of THC that the THC bridges the gap or otherwise facilitates the binding of the CBD to the necessary receptors in the brain to be effective.

The product I've just recently started taking is legal in my state.",266,ADHD_Forum
10,Blue Monday,Well-known member,"An update: I've settled on a daily routine of a morning dose of 25mg of CBD/1mg THC oil and then the same in the evening. Occasionally I've also taken a single 50mg CBD/2mg THC gummy at night before bed and I think that does help me sleep. When I take the oil/gummy night combo I'm getting 75mg CBD and 3mg THC. I know everyone is different in relation to their sensitivity to THC, but the 3mg THC isn't psychoactive in any way for me.

I have not gone past a max of 3mg THC in a dose in part because if I were to do so with any regularity, the cost would be frustratingly expensive. Things like this shouldn't be as expensive as they are.

At this point my long term goal if my state relaxes usage further and includes recreational use (not the case at this point) is to arrive at a dosage of CBD/THC which is very mildly psychoactive. In effect, micro-dosing THC to help with my PTSD, ADHD, Autism and anxiety. That's not the case for me at this point.",266,ADHD_Forum

16,Blue Monday,Well-known member,"I'm diagnosed with ADHD Inattentive Type and I'm over 50. I'm also diagnosed with Aspergers, but between the two, I consider my ADHD to be an actual disability in that it presents daily challenges to me FAR more than my Aspergers does.
I do not take any meds for my ADHD. Small amounts of caffeine helps to a degree.

One of my biggest challenges is reading books. I would love to read more books, but I usually buy a book or get one on loan from the library and I sit down and try to read it and it ends up being like unproductive work. The book then just sits unread.

Here's what my experience is like reading a book: I sit down and try to eliminate distractions. I've even put on passive noise cancelling headphones. I make a point to not have my phone, etc within reach. Then...I start to read. The first time reading a paragraph is me just getting familiar with the words, but I'm not really retaining the information. I have to re-read sentences (because my mind starts to wander) multiple times. By that time I end up having to re-read the entire paragraph more...than...once. Finally I tell myself: ""OK! Come on now! FOCUS! This isn't that hard. Really pay attention! You can do this!"" Every single page is like that. Even after I focus if I slog through a chapter for example, the next day my recollection of what I read is fuzzy at best. Bottom line is that my brain during book reading is like a hyperactive toddler who is told to sit in a chair for a period of time and absolutely doesn't do it and instead keeps leaving the chair every minute to walk around.

I had a rough patch last summer when Depakote got too high. I was delirious for most of June with sleepwalking, falling asleep while doing ordinary stuff, and angry liver and kidneys. I didn't fully recover until September.

I still take Depakote, but at less than 1/3 the dose that made me sick.

I was referred by my GP for an ADHD assessment after having severe anxiety, emotional and focus/concentration problems for my whole life and no treatments/approaches working as of yet.

That's easy: the one that works for you. Dexedrine and Adderal make me jumpy, but Ritalin hits the spot. Guanfacine and Lyrica help my anxiety and my bipolar meds help calm me down. Extended release stimulants poop out on me, so I take Ritalin immediate release 3 times a day.

72,Aurelius,Well-known member,"Maximum advised adult dose for ADHD is 40mg per day. Higher dosage levels than this have generally not been found to be more effective - but carry much higher side-effect risks ranging from increased vulnerability to addiction, to increased risk of mental health issues (i.e., psychosis or psychotic symptoms), to increased risk of major health issues (i.e., to the extent of very high doses being associated with sudden death).

60mg, in rare cases, is occasionally prescribed for people suffering from narcolepsy.

In my case 40mg increased my agitation, hyperactivity and (already chronic) insomnia. The increased hyperactivity was thought to be directly related to the increased insomnia.

Generally the daily dosage levels are increased by 5mg a week at a time until the best treatment outcomes are achieved. It is really important that this medically monitored and supervised by your prescribing doctor","1,652",ADHD_Forum

77,MiaKlausen,New member,"Hi all

I have a 12 year old son, who has a female friend, and she has recently been diagnosed with adhd. They have known each other since they were toddlers. It has alway been clear that some of her behavior was a bit off, we would just think ""bad manors"", ""a lone child behavior"" or simply ""purely raised"", but recently some traits has become more obvious. But the thing is that she adore my son and really cherish their friendship. And he is fond of her too, and he also have good times when they are together. They only see each other maybe every second month (we live far apart), when we will visit each other for a day or two. We are not the closest friends, but do enjoy their company, and they really want to hang out with us, probably also because she gets a long so well with my son. But I can see and hear, that it's really hard for him, especially on some occasions. Even though he won't say specifically, he is very worried if he say something that is not nice or might hurt someone. But more and more, he doesn't seem so eager to see her. When they are together, she is often stepping over his boundaries, even when he try to say no (he is not the best at this skill though). If they are asked to set the table or clean the room, she will do nothing, and he will do it all. He tell her that she should do her part, but she doesn't listen, and if for example her mom ask them again to finish, he will then do her part too, to avoid discussions. Sometimes they dare each other, just for fun, for example if you loose the ball on the beach you jump in to the water. When he loose, he jump in, as agreed, but when she loose, she makes excuses or end the game. He rarely gets his way, she decides most activities, and control most outcome of their interactions. She has even convinced him to give her a little kiss once even though he did not want to.
I know it's all little things and I also know that he is not the best at keeping his boundaries and holding on to his rights, so we are also working on this. However, his mild approach is working perfectly with all his other friends, boys and girls, where they have equal interactions.

In reality, he could just be done with it and choose other friends. We would not force him.
But on the other side, we would like for them to remain their relationship, since very lovely times do also come of it.

So now to the point. How do I help my son to thrive with this relationship, to manage her behavior or at least get some skills or ways of coping with it.
He does know that she has adhd, they joke with it, but only on a simple level in regards to for example her hyperactivity.

I know I should speak with the parents, but they are still struggling with it all, school and other social settings (she doesn't have many friends) and I don't wanna add to it right now, that their daughters behavior makes it very hard for our son to hang out with her, that she is over stepping his boundaries and behaving unfair to him. And that he might pull away for that reason.

I would just love some coping skills that my son could apply, or some ideas of what to tell him and how to guide him in this relationship.

Thank you in advance for your time.",1,ADHD_Forum

If we are trying to help your friend discover or diagnose the root of the problem, then focus in on the parenting issue.

141,Akio,Well-known member,"I have a diagnosis for ADHD-PI, which took years and lots of frustration to get. Afterwards I was sent to a place that is supposed to specialise in ADHD, but they were a bunch of idiots. They did try me on Concerta, which barely did anything, but instead of trying a different med (Vyvanse), they refused.
I was told by one of the psychiatrists there after being seen merely once, that he didn't think I had ADHD, but I instead had anxiety. Which was idiotic, because it's the ADHD that is a major cause of my anxiety. Plus, without knowing anything about me, it made no sense to tell me my diagnosis is incorrect.

So getting ADHD meds, can be difficult even with a diagnosis -- although they did try me on Concerta like I said. I think it'd be highly improbable without a diagnosis. You need a psychiatrist, to work with your GP, so your GP can prescribe the meds. If you ask for meds, they think you want to use the meds to get high or something. So ideally you need a diagnosis, and then you have to be careful how you word wanting to try medication.

Not being on meds to treat my ADHD, I've had to resort to other measures. Mainly eating healthily, it does help. Foods like blueberries with walnuts, help. Tea helps, better than coffee for me. Red Bull actually worked better than the Concerta for me. Exercise might help, and going out for a walk to clear your head if possible, can help you reset.
I've tried Modafinil as well. It helps me to stay focused on a task, but doesn't give that kick, to make me want to start something. I have real struggles starting something I'm not already interested in -- so if I went to college again, I can't manage to do things like homework.
Which is why I wanted to try Vyvanse, because I've heard that can give you the kick you need, to get going.

I don‚Äôt have a good experience with psychiatrists either. They‚Äôre very dismissive, don‚Äôt listen, some just make up what they want to suit themselves. I tried to discuss ADHD when I was under CMHT, but was summarily dismissed.
I have taken modafinil before, I forgot about that one. I could try that again to see if it helps my current issues. Caffeine helps with multitasking at work, feeling sharper when busy, but when I‚Äôm not physically busy I feel jittery, after a while I get worse anxiety as well.

Remember that movie ""Predator"" when the nasty alien has a device that helps him blend in the the background? It's like an expensive camoflage suit. Well, this is the way I feel in public when I act... normal.

It's a struggle to act normal as I tend to just start doing whatever comes into my head. For example, I might be in the supermarket and the urge to practice my kung-fu form pops into my head, or I might start doing a stretching exercise or something... So in my head I go ""Wait a minute. Part of the reason for your social isolation is just this; acting weird in public. So, knock it off"". I then activate my predator armour and try to walk the walk of the neurotypical. I'm standing normally in line, I'm talking to myself in my head rather than mumbling (I'm a mumbler), and I'm ""blending in""

My son was diagnosed with ADHD when he was 16 after his CAMHS counsellor spotted symptoms. He's now 17 and we've just recently started on the medication path. He started a couple of months ago on Medikinet XL (Methylphenidate) 10mg, and after a month or so moved up to 20mg.

He says he hasn't noticed a difference but we've noticed that since he moved up to 20mg he has become increasingly irritable, short-tempered and just cannot stop talking. He's always been a little bit that way, but this is another level.

Is this normal and/or part of the process? Unfortunately, noticing this change in him followed our progress call with his consultant who has recommended an increase to 30mg, and he's now on holiday for 2 weeks so isn't available for us to contact.

Might the move to 30mg get us past this point?

165,whitebreadlog,Well-known member,"Hey Nathan! üôÇ Welcome to the forum!

Starting to take a new medication often comes with an adjustment period for your body to get used to. It is possible that the symptoms you are experiencing are the side effects of the medication you are taking, especially if you are increasing the dose. In my experience with Duloxetine (SNRI), it took me a few weeks to overcome the side effects of tiredness and feeling on edge. I had to adjust again when the doctor increased my dose. If you feel unconfortable about increasing the dose so soon, perhaps you could discuss this with your doctor?

Medication can have very different effects on different people. Our bodies are complex organic machines and there is no one size fits all solution. It is too early to say for certain but it is possible that Elvanse just isn't suitable for you. Again, you doctor can advise you on this if you feel like it doesn't help, probably after a couple month trial period.

168,BYPPills,Active member,"@Nathan19771977 HI. So what you're feeling makes sense. The drug you're taking is an amphetamine. Everything you explained are classic effects of an amphetamine. Adderall, Vyvanse, meth, Concerta, Ritalin. These are all amphetamines. You can feel anxiety, loss of appetite, psychosis, euphoria, jitteriness, increased blood pressure, increased risk of cardiovascular events, insomnia.. You can get addicted. Experience withdrawal. Craziest part is amphetamines were invented to keep the Germans and later the British awake during ww2 to fight all day long. No doctor will ever tell you that.

With the scary stuff aside, these drugs do work. You might need to experiment with using a capsule and a hard tablet. Capsules will start to work slowly and the effects will rise throughout the day, lasting a long time. Tablets will work fast and the effects will be intense for a short time.

Tell your doctor side effects. Tell your doctor when the medication works and when it wears off. You probably might be taken off that amphetamine and switched to a different one that might suit your needs better. Or have dose changes.

Be safe. Know what you're taking. Ask questions.",27,ADHD_Forum

I wanted to get some advice from someone more knowledgeable on the subject so I thought maybe a post here could work. Please disregard or delete this if Im in the wrong place.

To start of, I would say I have gone by very well in life, I have a good job, a wife and two kids, but there is always that feeling in the back of my head that tells me Im wired abit difference. Things like chosing to be alone if I can. Instead of spending time with friends and family. I have 4 close friends, but feel no need to hang out or meet them at all. We mostly talk online. Going to social events make me uncomfortable. I would rather work or be home, than go to a party as an example.

Looking people in the eyes is a problem for me. By default I will just focus on peoples forhead. Ive also been told I might come of as rude or blunt when i speak. In my mind I havent said anything wrong though, but I often get comments like ""You did not really say it like that, did you?"". My wife calls me ""cold and feelingless"", because I lack empathy for people. Watching movies or reading news etc dosent affect my emotions like other people. Seeing my own children hurt themselves or cry feels annoying and can oftentimes irritate me. I havent cried or felt sad since forever it feels, last time must have been early childhood. Expressing or talking about feelings is not something I know how to do properly.

Im a restless fidgety guy. If Im not occupied with doing something my legs will often move or I will fidget with keys,pens etc. I bite my nails and even the skin on my fingers. This worsen if Im stressed. When Im in bed for the night I rub my feet togheter until I fall asleep, something I have done for as long as I remember. I hardly ever dream and I can‚Äôt conjure images in my mind. Picturing things or people is not possible, all I see is black. Im color blind aswell, but I dont know if thats related to anything neurological.

Im a chronic overthinker and overanalyze every bit of information Im presented with. Sending emails or messages at work about seemingly easy subjects might require rewriting said email or message 10-15times before I think its done properly. Sometimes I feel paranoid, like Im being watched, this comes and goes and isent present all the time. I hear sounds and smell things other dont at times.

Yep! Only in the last few years has this started happening a lot (I'm 43), but if I'm talking and anything at all interrupts my train of thought (other people, a bird, a loud noise, etc), I'll completely lose what I was saying. It literally feels like it just dissolved into thin air.

I notice it's particularly prevalent when I'm just about to switch from one topic to another. The interruption comes, and I have no ""prompt"" to remind me of the new / related topic I was going to talk about next. Sometimes I have literally only remembered a WEEK later!!!

I do that. My short term memory seems to be the problem: Sometimes I can't remember what I just said, thought, or did. Especially when I'm pressured or on deadline.

And I just don't multitask. That always fails and makes me feel overwhelmed, anxious, stupid, and bummed. Then my brain gets racy or numb for a while.

I'm older, so I can get away with these deficits better than I could when I was in school.

In high school and uni, my ability to hyperfocus got me through. I made achievement important, so I could hyperfocus on school, get superior grades, and create a reputation as an eccentric genius. I'm not stupid, but I'm not that smart. My secret hyperfocus power has faded as I've gotten older.

Well, that's the thing. I don't think I even HAVE ADHD. That ""diagnosis"" was completely inadequate. I've simply never exhibited any signs of ADHD at all until about 5 years ago now. I assign that to 5 years of daily benzo use, 4 decades of chronic, constant anxiety, huge apathy, depression and anhedonia which tends to make me incredibly bored (so I don't pay attention to much as nothing interests me or brings me pleasure) and irritability (because I'm so unhappy).

@stevie_sloth That's really interesting. I always had a fear that if I took anxiety medication for a sustained period of time, that it would be unhealthy. In fact I read this recently: I‚Äôm a psychologist ‚Äì and I believe we‚Äôve been told devastating lies about mental health | Sanah Ahsan

""recent research concluded that depression is not caused by a chemical imbalance of the brain.""

I also think that (not pointing a finger at you personally) social media has made people have a short attention span. People are always checking their phones, posting short and quick responses all the time. There is a lack of depth to conversations.

Oh yeah! I totally agree with you! My smart phone, as convenient and enjoyable as it is, has RUINED my attention span and any form of delayed gratification! I'm so glad that there was no internet at all until I was 18-19, and I didn't get my first smart phone until 2014 or something, when I was already 35-36. I have no idea how 2 year olds who right now are tapping away on their own iPads are EVER going to be...how we were. REAL? I don't know.

In terms of the benzos, I'm aware they've made me more distractable, more vague, less alert or astute at times. It's not ideal, but still better than not having them. I couldn't deal with that anxiety anymore.

In terms of my lifestyle, I sleep most of the day as I don't enjoy anything so I don't want to get up earlier than necessary. I stay up very late because I am more relaxed at night time and it's the only time I get alone to myself, after my partner goes to bed. So I'm basically giving myself a form of jetlag. I also don't eat in the day, even if I am up earlier. I have no appetite at all.

I have no routine. No real obligations. My brain is floating...in inertia. Most of the time I don't know what day it is or what week of the month it is. It takes me a few seconds to remember, and that's mostly from recalling what I watched on TV the night before.

All THIS is why I exhibit some symptoms of inattentive ADHD.","6,594",ADHD_Forum

I have my ADHD assessment on Friday after waiting for nearly 2 years! I have had quite a few negative experiences with my mental health team so in desperation I emailed an extensive list of my symptoms to my GP as I could no way explain them all in a 10 minute appointment! It was after reading my list that my GP referred me to the adult ADHD team, I was screened 12 weeks later and put forward for the full diagnostic ADHD assessment. I found sending in the list relieved a lot of pressure for me, as I knew that trying to cram everything into a 10 minute appointment would only heighten my anxiety and I would forget to mention important points. I think it would definitely help you when you have your appointment to ask your GP if you could send in a list of all of your symptoms. I hope this helps.

So nice to hear this and what you have achieved with work and sorting yourself regarding independent living. Give me hope for my autistic cousin. Unfortunately wether you are or aren‚Äôt autistic parents can be over protective. I have lived with my parents all my life (to many years to mention), they have questioned why I have paid ¬£150 for a picture, ¬£900 on a 4K TV, why I didn‚Äôt get back from the cinema at 2am.
My answer was ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs it go to do with you? I am in my 30‚Äôs. I didn‚Äôt realise I have to give you my itinerary for that days events.‚Äù So next time I did just that.

9am - Wake up, go to loo (photos attached)
9:30am - Shower + Shave. S**T please see above.
10am - Breakfast (Cornflakes 148 flakes in cereal bowl)
10:15am - Watch TV until time to get ready to go out. Various Shows
2pm - Lunch, crisp sandwich (Chicken Flavour)
2:15pm - Play a bit of Xbox with friends and confirm cinema times and meeting up location.
6pm - Got changed to go out, (then listed everything I was wearing)
7:30pm Meet friends at cinema.

You get the drift. But they have been protecting you for so long it is probably a strange feeling and worrying for them to let go. Do you ever go away with friends for a weekend or a weeks vacation? Perhaps you need to if you don‚Äôt and prove you will be safe. It can be very frustrating for you and your parents. The only thing is to sit down and talk it through.

198,gaandu,Member,"I've these few problems(I've not included the previous problems, only the remaining problems. BPD was the problem of my past but it's under control with medicine.):

1) Can't do eye contact with anyone.

2) I feel ""fear(or something"" to visit big stores or anything that looks fancy.

3) I feel I'm very inferior to others, even 5 year olds or 50 year olds, because I can't do things that others can do. Eg: living independently, moving abroad from my country, travelling, navigating , driving etc.

4) I don't want to face people. I want to face them as little as possible.

5) I am scared to do any jobs(because of social interactions there even if it's a tiny social interaction) at all. And neither do I like remote jobs. Even remote jobs require video callings and I can't do that eye to eye contact.

I'm 24. I've been medicating with a doctor since 2 years. Even before that I've been to few other doctors for 2 years. Nothing improves in this aspect, other aspects have indeed improved(I've mentioned at the end).

The doctors here in Nepal don't tell what problem you've. But it sounds like something between autism, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

These are the medications I'm using atm.

1)Divalproex sodium extended release tablets IP 500mg

2) Aripiprazole Tablets IP 15 mg

3) Quetiapine tablets IP (it's for sleeping only afaik)

Based on the research, this(Autism) can't be cured. In my experience of 4 years of treatment, I've came to a point that most mental health disorders can't be cured totally. If you get any mental health issues, you're most likely done for life. The doctors I've visited latter is the most renowned doctors of Nepal and I've full trust in their treatment. My internal mechanism has been cured, like dopamine is high, motivation is high, I'm more curios, I'm not depressed even if my life is this bad anymore. But sometimes I remember all these shitty stuffs and I'm scared of my future as well. Like How do I live without doing a job? And social life afterwards, then marriage; will anyone (forget decent or worst) want to marry to an autistic? Why should I ruin their life? And social life afterwards as well. Staying in Nepal makes things even more worse as Nepal is highly social country and being social is seemed as a success.


Please suggest best course of treatment for me. I by now know People like me are unlucky and can't be cured at all. But still if there's a ray of hope, please share some.

Also helps I got a sham ""psychological evaluation"", too. I went out to get one as my mental state declined from trauma over the years.

Someone presenting as very withdrawn, poor social skills, strange to the medics of the time interests in bark patterns, musical wordless patterns, hyperfocus on wild flowers, and on crumbling stone walls, aversion to strong light, avoiding loud noises, traffic, crowds, big buildings, and having difficulties talking about their feelings, would usually be labelled as schizophrenic, even though they were not talking about experiencing auditory or visual hallucinations. It occured to me. It was not until 2017 that I was diagnosed with autism at an adult autism and neurodevelopment clinic set up about 4 years earlier. Neurotribes by Silbermann is about the history of autism and does show how many people were diagnosed with schizophrenia in the past, who it turns out were on the autism spectrum.

229,mapletree,Active member,"Hi as there is now more learning bout Autism and eating disorders I am wondering what it is all about. Is it all Anorexia or are there atypical eating disorders. As such I am sending you an attempted overview of my own experience as a male. I do not know if it will be significant. I am also wondering if anyone has had a similar type of eating disorder or anything similar. Or is it just way out!


Below does not fully explain even then and I wish it was shorter.

I was surprised to discover the amount of Autistic people having eating disorders. I have had a serious eating disorder. It is not anorexia but I did not know of any other word to use years ago.


I have fears and phobias about eating. This is more than say textures it is how I imagine food will affect my mind. There do seem to be memories of problems with food textures however.


It is hard to explain but I will explain. Growing up it became clear that substances entering our body can affect our mind. Anaesthetic makes the mind blank so it takes the mind away. Also alcohol affects the mind. Words were used that say you lose contact with reality and feelings while drinking. People can lose memory of things if they drink too much. However there are degrees of this except if unconscious by anaesthetic. The concept and experience is mind taken away. However if someone says a herb can have an effect on the mind this might be mild. I started to be afraid of anything I ate or entered my body which I assumed could have any of this kind of effect.


It was as if foods could make me not awake so not conscious so not alive. I could not conceptualise degrees of awareness as in say the difference between a pint of beer and several bottles of whisky or dozens of tranquillisers that would make one unconscious. To me just touching a molecule of something could make me not awake. This extended to food, herbs and I would not take aspirin for years. As well if during the day I felt a little bit less aware of my environment or touch or I imagined so I would put it down to a food I had recently eaten. I would focus on seeing things and touching stuff to see if I was real. A mild effect was not mild and was no mind so no life so death. The worst panic attack I had was in the same range as being run over by a car as a child and screaming on the floor. It became serious, I lost weight. Once I did not eat at all for 8 days. It has been hard to describe. It was about object and self existence and fear. I could not distinguish between haze, fog dead or alive or white and black. White represents consciousness and black is nothingness therefore death. A few pints or tranquillisers would be haze so still alive so no fear but can‚Äôt see it or realise that.


I would like to know if anyone has ever had an eating disorder similar to this or know of anything similar. As well could it be related to Autism. Is it black and white thinking and object existence.


I have more eating disorder symptoms with fog in the winter. Fog is haze so something and something else so not binary. However I try to imagine the fog as particles in light or semi light at night. Particles of whatever are non binary if included in another substance. However to imagine particles is like trying to imagine hundreds of dots in the atmosphere and this is not pictorially representative.",38,Autism_and_Mental_Health_Forum

I am 32 years old , dating a gay 38 years old he is divorced with two children. we dating a year.
The children doesn't bother me very much. I think I am autistic and see many communication problems, but I work and do whatever needed.
I had a terrible difficulty in starting and maintain romantic relationship(i was so much lonley in the past year). It took me one year to find this man which I true love and he loves me. We have harmonic relationship and understand each other(he is also autistic).
But from time to time and especially in this period when we decided to look for an apartment together I had terrible thought.
Two main of them:
1. He will die before me because he is older and then I start to think that I can find some gay younger then 38 or maybe younger then me
2. He divorced I can find something better.
Also we were in a festival were was many men.. and I started to think that maybe some other man will suitable for me more..
I don't felt comfortable with that thought.

I can't deal with these thoughts I tried to say them that I truly love him and appreciate the relationship, also I say that it is so hard to find partner and also who will love me and care about me.. I was alone 5 years cant find the right person..
These thoughts make me feel bad! I don't like to be in doubt.. and these doubts ruining me and my joy from our relationship.. Is hw the right for me? I dont know!

and advices? maybe the thoughts are right and it will be better for me to stay in my own.. I just don't know.. they usually come and go but recently they coming much more .
what can I do?
these thoughts can effect the relationship, also they make me anxious and sad.. I start to asking myself if I made a right decision to stay together with him? In the past I broke up with him two times.. because I didn't know if it suitable able for me.. but after a time I got back to him. Because can't decide one and forever if the relationship is suitable for me but love him and want to be together..
so I am not sure if another break is good for me and us

I've had a really bad few days. Worst I've had in many years. I'm in the very privileged position of trying to buy a house with my partner and we're close to the end but also at a very uncertain time as we may have to pull out of the sale due to mortgage agreements and timescales (all very complicated and boring). We believed we would have a concrete yes or no last Friday, and I was okay with that and had made peace with loosing the house we wanted. Honestly didn't care which way it went just wanted to know. But apparently a deadline isn't a deadline and I freaked out. I felt like I literally couldn't cope with waiting any longer and when I got in from work had a huge meltdown. It was worse than I've had for many years, but with my partners help I got through it safely.


I had to work the next day, my bosses are very good and allow me all the adjustments I could need despite being undiagnosed but it was a hard day regardless. I don't really remember the evening but woke up the next day feeling very unwell. I felt too overwhelmed to do my usual routines and stayed in bed sleeping a lot. I ate a little bit of dinner but was sick in the evening a few hours later. I felt so physically exhausted and nauseous for the whole day that I wasn't even able to get my planner out of my bag. This is a huge deal for me as planning is one of my special interests and keeps me grounded. The following day I felt a little better but still nauseous. Spent a long time sleeping again. Wasn't able to do any planning and had very low motivation.


Today I have work, but 5 hours later than usual. I've managed to get myself up and half dressed (I don't ever put a bra and jeans on until I'm leaving because fuck that). Done my morning routine and got my planner out and planned my day off tomorrow. I'm really proud of myself, and have got some stim toys out and used them too. But I hate that I lost two days to this meltdown and the aftermath. All because of uncertainty. We likely will not be getting this house, which means we will have to go through all of this again. Right now, I have no idea how. I am a person who does need a fair bit of support, but my partner shoulders that burden. We are both at our wits end now, as we have no idea how to deal with the last few days where I just checked out of life really. I don't think I can do it again and I don't know how to pull myself out of things. I'm desperate for help right now, because I don't know how I'm going to deal with buying a house, having kids, getting a dog, having a wedding etc and all the other great things we have planned for the future. Am I just not able to have these things?",19,Autism_and_Mental_Health_Forum

241,Kevin L,Member,"I am an older man who was diagnosed with autism later in life.

I am hesitant to give you relationship advice because I have monumental problems maintaining relationships.

So--instead--I can elaborate on how my autism has damaged my relationships and--perhaps--this may be helpful by giving you a list of things that you shouldn't do.

1) If you tend to have an obsessive, special interest . . . don't inflict it on your sig. other by monopolizing conversation around one topic. Force yourself to follow his interests, and be engaged and ask intelligent questions.
2) Be honest about autistic sensory issues. If he enjoys loud heavy metal concerts, you may naturally try to force yourself to go with him to share the experience, but this may make you miserable, and he'll pick up on this and be hurt.
3) If you lack social insight, explain this to him so that he doesn't think of you as uncaring and insensitive when you make a social blunder.
4) If autistic sensory issues influence how and when you're intimate with him, make sure he knows so that he understands any awkwardness that may occur in bed.
5) If you have digestive issues, make sure he knows so that he's not insulted when you refuse to dig into a meal that he just cooked for you.
6) Make sure that he understands tactile sensory issues with clothing and fabrics, as you may sometimes dress inappropriately for certian situations (a costume party, a wedding, or a funeral are examples).

I'll get back to you when I think of more.

I hope this was helpful.

245,LostSoul77,Member,"Thankyou both for the welcome, I'm sorry my first post isn't the greatest message.

I've come to the conclusion that my family do not like it when I show emotions. I don't know why they don't, but they don't. The past 3 nights I have upset my partner because I was trying to talk to him about how distant I felt he was being towards me, but was fine with everyone else. That no one around me had said anything nice to me, but the icing on the cake was being the butt of everyone's ""jokes"" that were actually really hurtful. I still do not feel like my issue/feelings on this was validated at all, by anyone. I have also been the recipient of people taking their bad moods out on me.

I love having a laugh and a joke, but when it upsets someone, you stop and you apologise and you don't minimise their feelings.

My partner promised that he would do something for me without me having to reciprocate it. He did do what he promised (a week later than he promised it, but that part couldn't have been changed). He then proceeded to ask me to do something for him, which I didn't mind but would rather him not have promised that I wouldn't need to do anything in return. I expressed this to him exactly like this: ""I don't mind doing that for you, but please don't say you'll do something for me without expectation, if that's not the case."" He then got grumpy with me because of a facial expression I made before I did said task. However I tried to explain that in order for me to do the task, I had to move from my comfortable place (that I was falling asleep in - as I've not slept somewhat ok in 3 days).

It has made me feel like I can't do anything right, and that I'm still waiting for someone to do something nice for me, because they want to, not because they want anything in return. I feel severely neglected and incredibly lonely and they're 2 very overwhelming feelings.

I'm a severe people pleaser, both because I do not want to be disliked and because I do not want people to experience the feelings that I do on a regular basis.

I honestly feel that I do so much for everyone else but no one wants to even listen to me when I need to talk about my feelings.

I'm always making sacrifices so other people can get their needs fulfilled. But whenever I do *eventually/rarely* get mine fulfilled, I'm made to feel guilty üòî.

Apologies for the length of this, it's all bottled away because even though my family tell me to ""open up and talk to them"", when I do and I tell them specifically what I need from them, it's never heard or never followed through with.

I'm Autistic, with some form of PTSD and undiagnosed ADHD & OCD. Partner has a personality disorder but I suspect also has other undiagnosed issues too. I'm awaiting formal assessments and further therapy. Previous EMDR therapist told me that because I had a lack of emotional support (she's who made me realise this and want to address it), that she wasn't going to do official EMDR and instead ended up working on grounding techniques that don't work. Lack of support has also made me extremely anxious to start taking my new tablets as it'll make me worse for the first couple of weeks while they settle and people already can't deal with me üòû",5,Autism_and_Mental_Health_Forum

254,Kevin L,Member,"Hi guys. I'm new to the forum, and seeking answers.

I'm an autistic adult, and although I have a degree and credentials, I have trouble retaining jobs because of my autism.

In fact, I often get fired because I follow rules and procedures . . . rather than the reverse.

How does one find a balance between following rules, yet disregarding them enough to keep a job.

As an example, I was a security guard in a library, and part of my job is to evict people who are sleeping.

So, I catch a guy sleeping, and when I try to kick him out, he shows me a medical alert bracelet that says he has narcolepsy . . . so Ilet him stay. The manager writes me up because ""there is no exception to the rules.""

About a week later, an elderly man comes in with his wife. He is very spry, but she has end stage Alzheimer's, is paralyzed in a wheelchair, and she has tubes, a tracheostomy, oxygen, and is being cared for by a nurse that he hires to take his wife out of the nursing home.

I get suspended because she was unconscious and had her eyes closed, as there's no exception.

Here's where I get to the point: I get fired because I kick a woman out of the library because her baby is sleeping in the baby carriage. I was also checking prams at the entrance of the library, and telling people they were allowed to come in if they woke up their sleeping babies.

In my autism, I don't see a difference between a baby in a pram and an elderly, paralyzed, brain-damaged woman on life support when it comes to sleeping in the library . . . and no one believes me.

I don't want to be told that I don't have common sense, because if common sense doesn't work for the narcoleptic, and if it doesn't apply to an elderly, paralyzed demented woman on life support who is being treated by a nurse . . . then why is common sense suddenly relevant to a baby in a pram?

No one is willing to tell me the difference, because ""I refuse to play your game.""

I have social blindness from my autism, so what is it that I don't understand?

Situations similar to these always sink me at work. When I ask my boss for help in these situations, I get told ""If you're too stupid to figure that out on your own, then you're too stupid to work here.""

How do I see the difference between a dying woman in a wheelchair and a baby in a pram when it comes to sleeping in the library?

Any input would be deeply appreciated.

Hi Kevin and welcome to the forum. I am wondering where you live and work. Here in the states your boss, or manager could be possibly fired for this behavior. It is discrimination and unprofessional. Your boss should not call anyone stupid or speak down to anyone.
If someone has a medical card then it is reasonable to believe what you thought. If you were to see policies in writing, you might have made the correct decision in allowing the elderly man to stay as well as the person with the medical card.
It sounds like your boss lacks tolerance and understanding.","8,099",Autism_and_Mental_Health_Forum
256,Kevin L,Member,"Thank you for the validation. The library (I found out after the fact) was being sued.

A drug addict was evicted because he was sleeping at the computers, and he sued because he had hit rock bottom and was trying to find a rehab facility that would take him. Him nodding off was part of his disease, so the library was discriminating against him (in his mind).

This is why it kept getting hammered into us that there are no exceptions to the rules.

If this only happened to me at one job, then I could blame everyone else . . . but I run into very similar issues at many jobs, so it's me (and/or my autism).

As an example that involved violence, I worked as a pharmacy technician at a drug store when I was putting myself through paramedic school. It was a great job, as I had a pharmacist to help me study my meds.

So an elderly customer comes in to pick up his diabetes medicine, and he seems uncomfortable. He begs to use the restroom, as diabetes makes you need to pee more frequently. I say ""no problem,"" and I let him use the restroom despite me knowing that it's against store policy . . . so I broke the rules.

I get reamed out by the manager because customers are not allowed to use the restroom. If I keep letting them use the restroom, I'll get suspended and/or fired.

A week or so goes by when a pregnant woman comes to the pharmacy to pick up her special prenatal vitamins and other stuff that her OB wanted her to take, and she begs to use the restroom because she's pregnant, and I tell her ""no, it's against store policy,"" and she throws the vitamins at me and runs sobbing out of the store.

Her husband--a huge biker--is waiting for me when I get off work, and beats the hell out of me because I ""hurt his pregnant wife"" by not letting her use the restroom.

The police refused to press charges, and I got fired because ""we never refuse a bathroom to a pregnant woman."" When I asked about the elderly man with the diabetes, I was told that it was a different situation . . . and that I lack common sense because ""everybody in the world can see the difference.""

In my autism, I don't see a difference between a woman who needs a restroom because of her pregnancy, and an elderly man who needs a restroom because he has diabetes.

This is how I get fired for following policy.

I feel like if I could just see the difference between an elderly, demented woman in a wheelchair and a baby in a pram when it comes to sleeping in the library, I'd be home free.

261,Kevin L,Member,"@Signofthetimes Thank you for the validation and emotional support, but I know it's me. It happens to me again and again with different jobs.

I've run into problems like this because of how I treated gay people and people of different religions.

As an example of my job issues with gay people, please consider that I was a paramedic training officer in an EMS system.

Our medical director also taught at a local university, and we sometimes had nursing and medical students assigned for ride time on an ambulance when they were taking an elective emergency medical course for their certification.

I got assigned an RN to me who was working on an advance practice nurse practitioner credential, and he was utterly phenomenal. He had 7 years of experience working in pediatric and neonatal intensive care, and every doctor knew him and was on a first name basis with him, as he also taught certain courses. Even though I was the training officer, I learned far more from him than he did from me.

So, we got a call on a horribly sick kid with leukemia who was undergoing aggressive chemotherapy, and this 11 year old boy was also having a diabetic emergency at the same time, and he was on death's doorstep.

I felt like I was missing something, so I put my student in charge and delegated myself to being his resource person, and he performed magnificently and saved this kid's life with a phenomenal skill that bordered on the supernatural.

So, my point is that my student was very effeminate in a way that would cause most people to automatically assume that he's gay within 10 seconds of meeting him . . . and yes, my student is gayer than Ru Paul and Liberace combined.

The parents (especially the father) were deeply religious, and were horribly upset that I let a ""homosexual and pedophile"" handle their sick child when he's vulnerable. ""Homosexuals have to recruit because nobody is ever born gay, because God doesn't make mistakes."" So, if their kid turns gay, it will be my fault because I exposed him to ""homosexualist influences during a delicate stage in his masculine development.""

They drafted a letter of complaint, and had their entire church congregation and pastor sign it, and they sent copies to my agency, their congressman, and the division of EMS licensure.

The pastor sat on the board of the local Baptist hospital, and the hospital threatened to pull their contracts if the situation wasn't addressed.

I lost a promotion because I created the situation by being insensitive to the family's beliefs . . . when we had to move quickly and decisively in order to save the kid's life.

In my autism, I miss social nuances, and it would be nice to have the perception to understand how I could have handled the situation differently and saved the kid's life while keeping my promotion at the same time.",9,Autism_and_Mental_Health_Forum

""Would"" or could?

""Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, as manifested by the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive; see text):
Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, ranging, for example, from abnormal social approach and failure of normal back-and-forth conversation; to reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect; to failure to initiate or respond to social interactions.""
^In my opinion a person with anxiety, especially related to social anxiety could fit the above. However again, it's safe to say that many people with anxiety do not have the deficits described above. Could someone with anxiety alone meet the above? Yes. ""Would"" they? Not necessarily.

""2. Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, ranging, for example, from poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communication; to abnormalities in eye contact and body language or deficits in understanding and use of gestures; to a total lack of facial expressions and nonverbal communication.""

I see your point, but given that people with anxiety can also be extroverts and/or not have difficulty with social communication, etc it doesn't seem to be to be an absolute. Not that all autistic people are introverts.

Hyper/Hypo sensitivity to stimuli is an extremely common factor to autism. I don't think hyper/hypo sensitivity to stimuli is considered to be extremely common to anxiety or OCD.

Sounds like you're trying to mask in social situations but not completely sure how to behave to be accepted 'as normal', (or don't have the confidence to believe you can) so you copy the behaviour of someone you know is already seen as 'normal, friendly, popular' etc and make their identity your 'social mask'.

315,Comorbidity,Well-known member,"I think far too much emphasis is put on masking, EVERYONE masks, neurotypical people mask more than anyone else, because they are desperately afflicted by being pack animals and the need to conform and fit in and do what everyone else is doing

My personal view is that a lot of people on a certain part of the spectrum don't properly understand their condition, they talk about it and things like this as though they have a choice in it and are making conscious decisions in this behaviour

Through a series of epiphanies over the past couple of years I have arrived at the following conclusions about autism at a certain part in the spectrum I'd like you to all consider

Autism is a higher, greater, or wiser subconscious

Autism plots your life course and decides what is and what isn't good for you, it writes the movie of your life you're only an extra in, you don't decide

Those of us with exceptional gifts in some areas, forget the idea that we're super smart in some ways at certain things or that we found those things and followed an interest in them. Our autism found them, it is the super smart super articulate subconscious that learns and works all these things out for us, we can't really take an awful lot of credit for it even though it comes through us, we're not consciously working these things out ourselves

Everyone masks, autism, through holding every single memory we have including millions we don't remember or have access to, does an absolutely incredible process of calculating odds and probabilities across all our memories and experiences to decide whether or not an experience or venture of any kind will potentially be a good one for us/it, then releases the chemicals to give us the feeling it will be a positive thing and to go with it or the opposite.

If your autism believes it will be a brilliant and worthwhile learning experience and provide exposure to new environments, information, experience and people it calculations have deemed of potential value and that involves masking to present as a certain persona, that's what it will have you do, you don't have a choice

What autism does and has always done for me is it writes the movie of our lives we're but a mere extra in, it creates an incredibly sophisticated lifetime of programming, creating a new program for each next significant part when there has been change or it has decided for change, keeping what it deems necessary and worthwhile to keep and overwriting other things from past experiences and roles it deems no longer necessary, or closing the pathways for us to access those things, it's a super computer that continually tries to evolve us

It can occur that through extreme sustained trauma, other people can damage our programming, having the effect of having come into our head with a sizeable hammer and absolutely smashed all that beautifully painstakingly woven and crafted circuitry over so many years into millions of pieces, if that then leaves you with PTSD as it did me, there becomes an issue with the autism ability to write a new program and continue moving forward, which is where I have been for the past 13 years",575,Autism_and_Mental_Health_Forum

I can at least answer this; finding out I was autistic is helping me slowly come to accept the different experience of life I seem to have always have had to most others.

If your live is failing that's one specific ailment easy to discern compared to when it's your heart.

But when you're experiencing pathological mental behaviors, how do you objectively define and separate them? it's a whole lot more difficult. And often lacking any clear understanding of the exact source of these illnesses the medical science just kind of have to group a whole bunch of them together.

I often just talk a lot and the other party listens but I make sure they're okay with it and ask them questions too; I understand jokes and sarcasm and I'm not literal even though I'm direct, I speak in hyperboles a lot of the time which throws people off a bit lol; I'm not good with numbers; I can sometimes multitask it kind of depends; I don't get along with children... I don't get along with anyone really; I don't think my behaviour is really repetitive; I cant control my speech volume; I'm only sensitive to sounds, the feeling of clothes on my skin is normal to me; I don't really follow rules when interacting I'm just my natural weird self or I am closed off and leave at some point;",189,Autism_and_Mental_Health_Forum
322,Aurelius,Well-known member,"I hope this helps:

You do not have to have all of the symptoms to meet the diagnostic criteria.
Symptoms frequently show themselves very differently in different people.
ASD does not define us. We are individuals who have ASD. We, also, have our distinct biological makeup and our own unique personalities, personal traits, patterns of abilities (including particular strengths, areas we find more difficult), strategies and skills we have developed (including those we might use to cope with or avoid issues/situations that challenge us), things we have learnt from our life histories, etc.
Key areas that are looked for are (a) difficulties in interaction and social communication (these will differ from person to person) and (b) restricted interests and repetitive behaviours(these will also differ from person to person). A third area that should be checked out is whether there are any unusual sensory sensitivities, as these are often found in people on the autism spectrum - while they are not a diagnostic criteria, they can have very significant impact on different aspects of people's daily lives (both in terms of their internal worlds and their external worlds).
The previous third diagnostic criteria of language problems has now been removed, as it was unreliable and was not supported by the much stronger evidence base that is now available.
We do not know enough about masking across genders. Current evidence suggests that this may occur more in females and that in many cases they might start this process at a very young age (i.e., early childhood). One consequence is that masking can seen very differently in different people and may be 'conscious' (i.e., deliberately faking eye contact) or 'pre-conscious/unconscious' (i.e., internalising sensory discomfort). Masking such as 'mimicking the social behaviour of others (including gestures or facial expressions) can be 'pre-conscious/unconscious' (i.e., picked up and internalised unknowingly in early childhood) or can be 'conscious' (i.e., observed, rehearsed and performed deliberately).
We now know that the signs of ASD may differ between genders and many practitioners are aware of this when they consider diagnosis. I mention this as The diagnostic criteria for ASD have historically been based on the signs and presentation of ASD in males.
The following list (taken from a recently published report) might provide you with some idea of common gender differences. The list is far from comprehensive, but it does provide signs of an internal presentation of ASD, most commonly seen in school age females (although some of these are being increasingly acknowledged in males - as the signs and presentation of ASD in males has been largely focused on 'external' presentation):

May appear more social but find it difficult to understand social hierarchy, be on the peripheries of friendship groups, or have intense friendships with regular ‚Äòfallings out‚Äô. These differences in social interaction often become apparent in the pre-teen and teenage years when social interaction with peers becomes more nuanced.
May experience high levels of anxiety at school, but mask this at school, only to display distressed behaviours once they are home.
May have a range of techniques to compensate and hide their difficulties from teachers and staff.
May struggle with transitions, large and small, and also with unstructured times such as break or lunch times.
May display situational mutism (be unable to talk in certain situations)
May experience intense empathy (including towards animals)
May seem emotionally and socially younger than their peers.
May display a vivid imagination. This could include developing an elaborate fantasy world or taking great joy in escaping into fiction.
May enjoy collecting things ‚Äì as opposed to playing with the things they collect.
May exhibit perfectionist tendencies.
May stim (use self-stimulating, repetitive behaviours, such as finger clicking or spinning, to regulate or for fun) in ways that are less noticeable ‚Äì small movements or internalised.
May express strong opinions when they are not masking, and may be difficult to convince that they are wrong.

Absolutely‚Ä¶pretty much everything is being over-diagnosed. And it is not some nefarious, intentional conspiracy. It‚Äôs human nature.

In trying to help, we have created a system that encourages and provides incentives for people to be diagnosed with at least one of nearly 300 disorders. And while well intentioned, we have created a ‚Äúpill for every ill‚Äù culture.

The Problem With Overdiagnosis in Psychiatry | PCH
At PCH, we witness the problems caused by overdiagnosing mental issues on a near-daily basis. Here‚Äôs what those problems look like.

The mental health system is a great example of ‚Äúthe law of unintended consequences‚Äù or ‚Äúchandlers fence‚Äù. In trying to do what we think is correct we have created a bigger problem than the one we were trying to fix.","1,504",Autism_and_Mental_Health_Forum

In the US it's difficult to say, the for-profit motive obscures borderline diagnoses, because the clinician may not get paid much for 'I'm not sure' or 'let's wait and see'. People also put a lot of pressure on medical staff for concrete answers and a treatment framework.

The issue isn't over-diagnosis, it's borderline/uncertain diagnoses and what is 'best practice' in the interim:

'As next steps, we need to adopt a uniform definition of diagnostic uncertainty and work toward methodological advances in measuring diagnostic uncertainty in medical practice.'

Yeah so my psychiatrist said that I show some of the symptoms of ASD but he was leaning more towards ADHD and OCD as a diagnosis. I live in Australia, and you apparently have to go through some other process to be diagnosed with ASD which he said can be fairly arbitrary, depending on who is doing the assessment. He said it's certainly possible that I am somewhere to the very lower end of the spectrum, but he didnt seem to think it was worth pursuing at this stage. I think I do a pretty good job of masking my symptoms though.",14,Autism_and_Mental_Health_Forum

I am extremely hyper empathetical. If I were to sit in a waiting room somewhere, I could feel every single persons feelings in that room. I also, for this reason, feel things we can't see, like spirits (people who have passed on) and even communicate with them. My hyper empathy masks symptoms like not being able to read body language very well. But when someone is very closed off and tough to read their feelings with, there's a big problem. Cause I just can't properly read body language. And due to me having been through what most people take like 30 or 40 years to go through as a 20 year old I'm really good with situations where people need consolence and help. If it weren't for that, I wouldn't know how to deal with those kind of situations.

My ADHD masks my social struggles a lot too. I am someone who only sometimes struggles with eye contact. And I am someone who appears really outgoing and social. And part of me definitely is. But I am still introverted and socially awkward. Social situations aren't my strong suit. As you get to know me better you start to see that.

So, my symptoms are so masked by other things that they really only tend to cause problems for myself and not others. That's of course a part of the problem with getting a diagnosis.",27,Autism_and_Mental_Health_Forum

Children with Autism who do speak, they speak just as people without Autism.

353,Ponder,Former member,"@Bubbles17 I don't regard any statistic as true or fact. But can appreciate the wish to share them. I find most stats just create or manifest something that never really existed. In fact I find many of the statistics to miss the mark, distract and interrupt people from seeing the world from through their own perspectives/experience. Such marketed claims can also taint the information when trying to read others.

OK - Now I can SPEAK - I post often and speak to myself like a 6 year old lone child playing with his imaginary friend caring less what anyone else thinks. My youngest daughter who was not diagnosed until decades later grew up without hardly speaking a word and now my grandson who is hard to keep quiet hardly speaks once he goes out the front door. I sometimes can't shut up when feeling comfortable in a like minded group but also at other times can't speak only to later be really upset that I did not. Basically my family shatters many of those statistics that many bring up which is just another reason I find they are less helpful than promoted.

To answer your question now that I feel comfortable have processed what I found conflicting ... is that when I am struggling with what has been said I am unable to speak mostly because I am still accessing. I become frozen during those bouts and typically easily led. Depends where I go and other dynamics such as ADD which is actually quite common (or so they say) with ASD can play into the whole freezing up scenario.

Stut stut stuttttering like a bouncing knee when thinking on something at lightening speed or accessing at lightening speed or perhaps multitasking different parts of the brain whilst taking in all the sensory overload of sounds, lights, body language, temperature, all at varying degrees ...

Choice? Am I choosing to go mute during such times? Perhaps more a case my ASD traits become more heightened when I feel enclosed, unsure, threatened, uncomfortable that I suddenly find myself unable to speak - but how much of my 'shutting down' do I 'allow' to happen when in such a space and happenings?
Am I able to switch these states on and off? To be honest ... yes I can. In fact many times I wish I could more than not. Should I speak or should I not? Should I call upon my fidgeting and or other super powers to comfort me and or make it obvious that I'm not comfortable? Like that sign should not read like so and that person should not of crossed broken that rule ... a stutter hear and a stutter there ... will I say something or will I not?

I know I am going to *&^% it up so I should say nothing at all?

I don't know @Bubbles17 ... there are many reasons why sometimes I choose to talk and others I don't. Some of them related to my ASD traits but there may be other reasons attributed to other labels and some not. Anxiety, Fear most of all rather than some well calculated decision to hold back. I do know though ... that regardless of often losing my speech for any number of reasons ... I often enjoy the peace to be found despite in the moment others typically exploit or take advantage or me. I know that sounds weird. Whilst in my youngers days I was very naive through lack of experience and understanding ... in my older years I am more misunderstood as naive during these moments I am unable to speak.

Best I can say when it comes to choice in these moments, is I do well not to react when knowing full well I am being lead. When I am not doing well, is when I react self harming in public by bashing my head and or stammering at the same time. But to be sure there are times I am much calmer and still get flustered and unable to talk. Yet I might walk 10 meters after existing the space of another, then open up to my support worker without a thought.

I am 53 years old ... but I can also tell you it is very much the same for my 6 year old grandson. Not that the statistics would get that right. My daughter ... she has good masking abilities. I say give her a few more decades and she'' follow suit soon enough. hehe. Just kidding. Only she could tell here story.

Here's the thing and again why I care less for statistics when trying to look at things with a narrow view (one box ... one label) most of us in this messed up world have more than one label. More than one traits or categorized set of symptoms. In my younger day I did not exhibit to the same degree as my grandson does today. I did have enough learning difficulties though to be targeted by teachers (who had their own issues) and experience that classic cases/stories of abuse. I become a statistic with a myriad of labels later in life before I ASD was added to the list. To be sure I had the traits when I was the same age as my grandson is now, but It was not until much later in life that my traits had become as well seen as my grandson's. This is where I kind of giggle with statistics ... hard to explain. There is a crossover affect that is not often taken into account.

I see it as the same when I freeze up and or tell myself I am choosing not to talk. From a spectral perspective mixed a host of symptoms, I'd say I struggle most of the time to speak in public situations when ordering a sandwich or asking for directions because I can't keep up with how check out staff, drive through attendants and or most people in public speak at such a rapid pace. The rush rush and all that when standing in line and everyone waiting ... pressure and all that. That's not selective - that's just unable to process mode.

I was once selected to be speak on behalf of a mental health group in my local area for a yearly seminar in our capital. So it is that yea, I can speak, but then others times I can't.

That's the best I can share that. I live in a world that wants all the answers condensed into two sentences or a limited number of characters. I guess that's when I go mute.

At any rate ... hope this finds you well. I feel better for having shared. It's a genuine challenge I struggle with but I am in no way ashamed for it. I just don't tweet and ignore people who tell me in reddit TO LONG DID NOT READ also known as TLDR. I smile to think that they then try to answer something they never took the time to read.

I have Asperger's Syndrome. The eye contact phenomenon is a direct result of over-analysing a behaviour that doesn't require it. When you start getting into techniques on how to apply the correct amount of eye contact or how to make eye contact the correct way, it leads to even greater over-analysing.

This creates a problem for 2 reasons.

1) Neurotypicals pick up on this over-analysing behaviour right away which can come across as extremely awkward and uncomfortable.

2) If your mind is busy focusing on eye contact techniques, you're not focused on the conversation itself. Which can make you seem disinterested in what the person is saying to you. Which can give off the impression that you're ignorant.

The best way to deal with this, isn't to formulate techniques. It's to do the exact opposite. Stop caring about how much eye contact you're making or how you're making it. You're doing it right when you're not even thinking about it.",187,Autism_and_Mental_Health_Forum

Its more of a sort of general mmemotic device, but it may still be helpful if you feel confident enough that it won't interfer with the conversation itself.","1,048",Autism_and_Mental_Health_Forum

Yeah, same. Either too much or too little and I really hate when people notice when it's too little. I can tell when they notice, and some get really flirty or seem to realize they may have an upperhand and will take advantage later on.

I've just learned to deal with it. Some people I'm better at it with than others, and some people make me so uncomfortable about it. I just accept it because I can't really help it.

At this weight 7 stones, a GP needs to know and an inpatient stay in hospital is probably necessary as it is life threatening and could lead to multiple organ failure. I am trained in Holistic Therapy and nutrition, in North Wales, though am now living in Scotland. Autism is a complicating factor, and medics need to know about this and your particular difficulties with food. Please speak with a doctor immediately. If a GP appointment is not given very quickly, go to A & E, as you are at a life threatening and multiple organ failure stage of eating so little that your body is almost unable to sustain life. This is an emergency, and needs to be acted on very quickly. I am still affected by a case of a young woman who had problems with eating, went to the University of East Anglia, and the GP clinic there failed to monitor her very closely and frequently and she died. It went to an inquiry and the GP centre was cricised for failure to protect her life. Please don,t let this occur with you. Let me know on this site how you get on with getting medical attention.

I‚Äôm just recently coming to terms with being autistic, and recently returned to working after a meltdown over the past few years.

This is a really superficial issue but I like going to the toilet a few times a day to get a few minutes of quiet time. I‚Äôve always done this. But the toilets at work here are busy and the hand dryer is cataclysmically loud. Nobody else seems to think so but it makes me cover my ears and want to scream or rip the thing off the wall.

So my question; is it acceptable for me to use the disabled toilet?

These two are especially wonderful - the three of them together are amazing. Forget stereotypes - these three have me in stitches laughing and are massively kind and empathic.

I am very confident the other one will find their way creatively later on, after School years end. Whilst they do have social anxiety alone, they have massive confidence together as a group currently.

Magical thinking is not all about being millionaires. It's about encouraging and motivating people to survive and be a best version of themselves. This is why we have entertainment. Without it we'd be extremely poor. I'm sure the strongest would survive, but many would just die. I read about this in my theatre text. It talked about this, and at first I thought it was dumb to think that people would just die without entertainment, but now I see very clearly why they would...either that or join one of the oldest professions...prostitution...and some would possibly convert to religion for a sense of purpose or entertainment (boring to me).

482,CabbageMama,Well-known member,"@mischief Thank you very much for highlighting this. It‚Äôs something I am very aware of, because my child was born a girl, and identifies as a boy. It has been established already that they meet high criteria for autism - though they have not been able to have the proper assessment because they also meet high criteria for trauma as they have been abused. It makes the assessment process very complicated - they are undergoing therapy to try and reduce the impact of the trauma, but this is difficult, because they are autistic... I am doing the therapy with him, it is the only way he would engage.

He is presenting as very trans and very autistic now, not in any negative senses of the phrasing, but it has all just ‚Äòcome out‚Äô at once. I have had a lot of contact with other Parents of trans kids and apparently it is not uncommon for this to happen. I had thought we were the only ones. He hadn‚Äôt been in School at all this year, but I have managed to get him back in to an Education setting for a short period a day on a 1-1 basis. Just for a few weeks so far, but massive progress. His MH has been dreadful, but it is difficult to know what is from the abuse and what might have been issues that would have been there already.

Looking back, he was always different. I inadvertently taught him how to mask in order to fit in, make friends and do well, I think. So effectively that no issues were actually picked up on. I was a stay at home Mum, so always there before and after School to be an anchor and a comfort. We have always had an especially strong bond. I don‚Äôt think I really understood how much he relied upon me to be what I was and do what I did, because it was just how we were. Until we were not able to be.

I have worked with children and adults with varying degrees of learning disability. Autism and Aspergers. I genuinely had no clue whatsoever that Alex had Autism as he was growing up. He told me last year he thought he did. That was at a time he was self harming a lot and very spontaneously, almost out of nowhere. His behaviour was very erratic, one moment we were exceptionally close, cuddling and laughing, the next he was shouting and screaming at me, saying he wanted to die. I always listen to my children and I googled it. It was when it made perfect sense with a lot of what I had been experiencing with him. Alex is never wrong about stuff like this tbh.

Anyway, because we were in a difficult place with Services - I was being accused of being a bad Parent at the time because my Parents had Agencies convinced it was so. When I told Children‚Äôs Services that Alex had told me he thought he was autistic (he was identifying as non binary then) and that I thought it was the case, because of the research I had done - directed her to the research, I was told it was an excuse for my Parenting, because I had mental health problems. My Parents had also told them I was an alcoholic, which wasn‚Äôt true, but I think influenced them a lot. They would not liaise with my CMHT until much later on, despite my imploring them to and my CMHT a making every effort to. Camhs eventually suggested Autism may be a possibility just before Alex came home to me in November, after 3.5 month of living with his abusers. It is acknowledged by all Services now, after an extensive Clinical Psychologist evaluation that high criteria for autism is met, we just have yet to receive the actual diagnosis. That could take quite a while. But he is autistic.","3,209",Autism_and_Mental_Health_Forum

I would appreciate any advice or experience anyone has with devices they use for auditory processing issues. I don't know where to begin as far as what different kinds and functions, what brands, usual pricing, etc. Comfort is a huge priority for me, I'm sensitive to certain things touching me. I have over the ear, in the canal aids with small fitted tips that do not distract me so bad. I need to figure out if I should return my hearing aids before my trial is over, which will be soon. If the devices cost a lot, I will have to probably.

Backstory: I've had trouble with my hearing since I was young but never had my hearing checked, I'm 30 now. The last two years since the pandemic, with everyone wearing masks, I noticed just how bad my hearing really is. I never thought much about it before because it was never a volume issue, i just couldn't understand people sometimes. When this started impacting my mental health more recently, I decided to try hearing aids. Being in the US and not having health insurance, I ordered them online with the company's hearing test using my own earbuds. It showed I had sensorineurol loss, but not significant. At the worse 25 dc loss on lower frequencies, but no conductive loss. When I received my hearing aids, they didn't seem to help much with speech though the clarity of noise is nice. So I went to an audiologist for a test and it showed basically the same results, and the audiologist confirmed that some sort of speech specific listening device would benefit me more. I didn't get a chance to go over options and brands and can't really afford another visit out of pocket. I do have mild loss, and do like the benefit I receive from the aids, but the speech distinguishing issue is what's most important as it's impacting mental health and ability to work.

Thanks for any advice you can offer",33,Autism_and_Mental_Health_Forum
